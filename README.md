About
-----

.app.icns was started by [Andrew](http://twitter.com/andrevvm) & [Kara](http://kara-z.com).


Installation
------------

We use a nice piece of software called [CandyBar](http://panic.com/candybar) to manage our icons. Just open up the iContainer file and click 'Use these icons' for easiest installation.

You could also use [LiteIcon](http://freemacsoft.net/liteicon).

Some icons, like iCal, require manual installation.
